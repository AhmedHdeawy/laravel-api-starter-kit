# Laravel API Starter Kit Documentation

## Idea Brief

The Laravel API Starter Kit is a comprehensive boilerplate designed specifically for backend developers who need to quickly scaffold RESTful APIs using Laravel. Unlike general-purpose starter kits, this one focuses exclusively on API development, implementing industry best practices like Service and Repository patterns to ensure clean, maintainable, and testable code.
This starter kit aims to solve common challenges in API development by providing a standardized structure, consistent response formats, and allowing developers to focus on business logic rather than repetitive boilerplate code.

## Understanding Laravel Community Starter Kits

Laravel's community starter kits are pre-built application scaffolding created and maintained by the Laravel community. They extend the concept of official Laravel starter kits (like Breeze and Jetstream) but are tailored for specific use cases.

## Core Features

The API Starter Kit includes the following core features:

- Service Class Pattern
- Repository Pattern
- Standardized API Response Structure
- API Versioning
- Query Builder (Dynamic filtering, sorting, and pagination using Spatie Query Builder)
- Authentication using JWT
- Request Validation
- Resource Transformers
- API Documentation
- Telescope for Development & Debugging.
- Code Quality Tools (Pint, Larastan, IDE Helper)
- Pest for Testing (already configured and ready to use, see current tests).
- Docker Configuration
- Git Hooks (pre-commit and pre-push to automatically run Pint, Larastan, and test suites)
