# Laravel API Starter Kit Documentation

## Idea Brief

The Laravel API Starter Kit is a comprehensive boilerplate designed specifically for backend developers who need to quickly scaffold RESTful APIs using Laravel. Unlike general-purpose starter kits, this one focuses exclusively on API development, implementing industry best practices like Service and Repository patterns to ensure clean, maintainable, and testable code.
This starter kit aims to solve common challenges in API development by providing a standardized structure, consistent response formats, and flexible authentication options, allowing developers to focus on business logic rather than repetitive boilerplate code.

## Understanding Laravel Community Starter Kits

Laravel's community starter kits are pre-built application scaffolding created and maintained by the Laravel community. They extend the concept of official Laravel starter kits (like Breeze and Jetstream) but are tailored for specific use cases.

## Core Features

The API Starter Kit includes the following core features:

- Service Class Pattern
- Repository Pattern
- Standardized API Response Structure
- API Versioning
- Comprehensive Authentication Options
- Request Validation
- Resource Transformers
- API Documentation
- Query Builder
- Optional Modules

## Feature Details and Implementation Steps

### Service Class Pattern

Brief: The Service layer encapsulates business logic, making the code more maintainable and testable by separating concerns.

Implementation Steps:

- Create base service interface and implementation
- Set up service provider for dependency injection
- Implement example service for User model
- Document service pattern usage

### Repository Pattern

Brief: The Repository pattern abstracts data access logic, making the code more maintainable and testable by separating concerns.

Implementation Steps:

- Create base repository interface and implementation
- Set up repository provider for dependency injection
- Implement example repository for User model
- Document repository pattern usage

### Standardized API Response Structure

Brief: A consistent JSON response format for all API endpoints, including standardized error handling and HTTP status codes.

Implementation Steps:

- Create ApiResponse trait with standard methods
- Implement response middleware
- Create base API controller with response methods
- Document response format

### API Versioning

Brief: API versioning allows for the management of different versions of the API, making the code more maintainable and testable by separating concerns.

Implementation Steps:

- Set up versioned route structure
- Create versioned controller directories
- Implement version-specific request and resource classes
- Document versioning strategy

### Authentication Options (JWT)

Brief: Authentication system using JWT.

Implementation Steps:

- Create modular auth configuration
- Implement JWT authentication module
- Implement Authentication flow (Login, Register, etc.)

### Query Builder

Brief: Dynamic filtering, sorting, and pagination for API endpoints.

Implementation Steps:

- Install and configure Spatie Query Builder
- Implement base query builder functionality
- Create example endpoint with query builder
- Document query builder usage

### API Documentation

Brief: Automated API documentation generation using OpenAPI/Swagger annotations.

Implementation Steps:

Install and configure L5 Swagger
Set up example controller annotations
Create documentation templates
Document how to extend API documentation

### Optional Modules

### Role & Permission Management

Brief: Role-based access control for API endpoints.

Implementation Steps:

- Install and configure Spatie Permission
- Create role and permission seeders
- Implement authorization middleware
- Document RBAC usage

### Development & Debugging Tools

Brief: Tools for debugging and development, including Laravel Telescope and IDE Helper.

Implementation Steps:

- Create optional installation for Laravel Telescope
- Set up IDE Helper configuration
- Configure Larastan for static analysis
- Document development tools usage

### Monitoring & Error Tracking

Brief: Tools for monitoring API performance and tracking errors.

Implementation Steps:

- Configure Activity Log for user actions
- Set up Sentry integration for error tracking
- Implement request/response logging
- Document monitoring setup

### Testing Framework

Brief: A testing framework for API testing, including unit and feature tests.

Implementation Steps:

- Configure PHPUnit or Pest
- Create base test case for API testing
- Implement example API tests
- Document testing approach

### Docker Configuration

Brief: A Docker configuration for API development and deployment.

Implementation Steps:

- Set up Dockerfile for API container
- Create docker-compose.yml for development environment
- Set up database container
- Document Docker setup

### Deployment

Brief: A deployment strategy for API deployment.

Implementation Steps:

- Set up deployment pipeline
- Configure deployment environment
- Implement deployment strategy
- Document deployment process

### CI/CD Templates

Brief: Continuous Integration and Deployment templates for GitHub Actions.

Implementation Steps:

- Create GitHub Actions workflow templates
- Configure automated testing
- Document CI/CD setup

### Installation Process

The API Starter Kit will include an interactive installation script that:

1. Creates a new Laravel project
2. Prompts for authentication method selection
3. Offers optional modules to include
4. Installs required packages
5. Sets up base files and configuration
6. Runs initial migrations and seeders
7. Document installation process

### Directory Structure

The starter kit will follow a clear directory structure that separates concerns:

│   ├── Controllers/
│   │   └── Api/
│   │       ├── V1/
